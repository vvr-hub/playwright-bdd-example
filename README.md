# Project with Playwright-BDD, TypeScript, Cukes, POM, Gherkin

## About the project

This is a **work in progress** automation test project that's built using [playwright-bdd](https://github.com/vitalets/playwright-bdd)

*  It has a few sample automated tests for a [demo website](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/). The aim is not to cover 100% of the functionality in these tests. The coverage is minimal. Created this scalable, maintainable and robust test project in Playwright, Cucumber, TypeScript and Gherkin adopting playwright-bdd and page object model using some best practices.
*  Some tests fail if the owners of the demo Orange HRM website change or removeÂ the functionality, items in the left side panel, GUI elements on the pages, API end-points, etc.
*  The project uses a non-existent `staging` environment to showcase environment switching capabilities.

## Features

* Page Object Pattern
* Parallelisation
* Retries for failing tests
* Reporting
* Easy Test Environment Switching
* Test Data Separation
* Cross Browser (Compatibility) Testing - Chrome, Firefox, Safari
* Randomisation (Example: creates employee with random details, selects random items in dropdowns, or from enums)
* Avoids hardcoding, duplication, flakiness and sleeps
* Reusable utils and functions (step definitions)
* Scalability, Maintanability, Readability, Stability, Adoptability

## Project Setup

#### Prerequisites:

* Git
* VS Code (or another IDE)
* Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
* nvm (Node Version Manager)

#### Steps:
1. Clone the project to your local machine
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vvr-hub/playwright-bdd-example.git
   ```
2. Change directory to `playwright-bdd-cukes-ts-hr`
   ```
   cd playwright-bdd-cukes-ts-hr
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Install browsers
   ```
   npx playwright install
   ```

## Setting the Test Environment and Running Tests

#### Setting Environment:
Below commands are for Unix based OS (e.g., bash, **Z Shell**).
*  To set the target environment to staging environment
   ```
   export NODE_ENV=staging
   ```
* To set the target environment to prod environment
   ```
   export NODE_ENV=prod
   ```
* To see which environment is set
   ```
   echo $NODE_ENV
   ```

Below commands are for Windows OS (e.g., **PowerShell**).
*  To set the target environment to staging environment
   ```
   $env:NODE_ENV = "staging"
   ```
*  To set the target environment to prod environment
   ```
   $env:NODE_ENV = "prod"
   ```
*  To see which environment is set
   ```
   echo $env:NODE_ENV
   ```

#### Running Tests:

*  To run a specific script from `package.json`:
   ```
   npm run <script-name>
   ```
    
   **Example** (running all tests in production, parallel and headless):

   ```
   npm run prod:all:parallel:headless
   ```
   Please refer to the **scripts** section in `package.json` file for a variety of commands to run Playwright Tests, headed, headless, parallel, target browser, specific environment, smoke tests, regression tests, etc. These scripts are for Unix based OS (e.g., bash, **Z Shell**). Please modify them for Windows OS (e.g., PowerShell).


*  To run a specific Test Suite (e.g., EmployeeManagement) in Unix based OS (e.g., bash, **Z Shell**):
   ```
   NODE_ENV=prod npx bddgen --tags "@EmployeeManagement" && NODE_ENV=prod npx playwright test --headed
   ```
*  To run a specific Test (e.g., Test-3) in Unix based OS (e.g., bash, **Z Shell**):
   ```
   NODE_ENV=prod && npx bddgen --tags "@Test-3" && NODE_ENV=prod npx playwright test --headed
   ```

*  To run a specific Test Suite (e.g., EmployeeManagement) in Windows OS (e.g., PowerShell):
   ```
   NODE_ENV=prod; npx bddgen --tags "@EmployeeManagement"; NODE_ENV=prod; npx playwright test --headed
   ```
*  To run a specific Test (e.g., Test-3) in Windows OS (e.g., PowerShell):
   ```
   NODE_ENV=prod; npx bddgen --tags "@Test-3"; NODE_ENV=prod; npx playwright test --headed
   ```

#### Viewing Reports:

*  Run
   ```
   npx playwright show-report
   ```
*  Then open the following url in your browser

   `localhost:9323`

## About the project structure
Below are details about some of the key folders and files in the project:

*  `features/` - Business-friendly Tests in BDD format written in Gherkin.

*  `stepDefinitions/` - Steps which invoke the respective page functions.

*  `pages/` - Implements the actions or checks performed on each page within the web application. These functions are reusable.

*  `pageElements/` - Page-wise UI elements used by functions in the `pages` folder.

*  `constants/` - Includes constants such as API end-points that are called behind the scenes while performing tests on the application.

*  `models/` - Defines Enums and Types related to the web application. Not all may be used currently.

*  `utils/` - Contains (potentially) reusable utility functions, such as date formatting, picking values from enums, etc. These functions are not specific to the application's functionality but support testing.

*  `envConfig.ts` - Manages environment-specific configurations (e.g., base URL, login credentials, test data in future).

*  `playwright.config.ts` - Contains Playwright settings (timeouts, parallelisation, viewport, retries, screenshots, trace, etc), browser and platform coverage

*  `package.json` - Defines project dependencies (libraries) and includes scripts for setting environments and running tests.

*  `playwright-report` - Stores test reports generated by Playwright.

*  `pageIndex.ts` and `fixtures.ts` - Provided by the playwright-bdd framework
The individual Page Object Models (POMs) defined in separate pages in the pages folder are imported in pageIndex.ts file. It then re-exports them from this single access point (Centralised Exports). The fixtures.ts file imports all POMs from pageIndex.ts file, instantiates them and provides the (reusable) instances to step definitions.


## Acknowledgement and Thanks
*  **Vitalets playwright-bdd example** project has been very useful in creating this project.
*  The demo website for **Orange HR Management web application** has been very useful for writing sample tests in this project
